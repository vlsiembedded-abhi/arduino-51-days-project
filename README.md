# 51 Days Arduino Project 🚀

This repository contains my **51 Days Arduino Learning Journey**.  
Each day I build and document one Arduino project, starting from the basics like LED blinking to more advanced projects using sensors, displays, and communication modules.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- Each day has its own folder:
  - **Day 01** → Blinking LED  
  - **Day 02** → Traffic Light System  
  - **Day 03** → 7-Segment Display Counter  
  - ... up to **Day 51** 🎯  

Inside each folder:
- **Code** → Arduino `.ino` file  
- **Circuit Diagram / Image** → Hardware setup photo

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn Arduino programming step by step.  
- Explore sensors, displays, motors, and IoT basics.  
- Build a strong foundation in Embedded Systems.
